# 🖼️ Transforming Images with Filters
This project demonstrates how to manually apply basic image transformations using Python — without relying on advanced image processing libraries like OpenCV or NumPy.

### 📁 Overview
This notebook explores how to:

Load and display images using Keras and Matplotlib

Convert images to grayscale using the luminance formula:
Gray = 0.299 × R + 0.587 × G + 0.114 × B

Convert grayscale images to black and white by applying a threshold

Visualize each transformation step

### 📌 File
Transforming images with filters.ipynb — contains all the image transformations with code, comments, and visual output.

### 🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

Keras (for image loading)

Matplotlib (for plotting)

### 🧪 Example Output
Original image

Grayscale image

Black and white image using thresholding

Each step is visualized in the notebook.
